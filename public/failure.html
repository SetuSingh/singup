        <p style="font-size: 2rem !important;">Success and failure are the two sides of the same coin. There is not a single person who has not seen a failure in life. One should not feel disheartened at a failure but should try to learn from his failures. Failures are the stepping stones towards success. For example, a talented scientist becomes a famous scientist only after seeing a lot of failures. Similarly, Napoleon became the Emperor of France only after many failures. King Bruce of Scotland learned a valuable lesson from a spider which continued its efforts to go up the cave even after failing eight times. After the eighth effort, the spider finally succeeded because it kept on trying. King Bruce also made efforts and was able to win back his kingdom eventually. So basically, the thing is to try and keep trying until one succeeds. It is a failure rather, which motivates a person to emerge successfully.</p>
